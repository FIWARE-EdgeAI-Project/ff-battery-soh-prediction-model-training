# Datasets & Scenarios

The data is generated for six different scenarios:

- Normal usage, optimal charging
- Normal usage, full charging
- Normal usage, frequent top-ups
- Normal usage, deep discharge
- High usage, optimal charging
- Low usage, optimal charging

Files are named according to the pattern: 

`{usage}_usage_{charging}_charging_battery_data.csv`
